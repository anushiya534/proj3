            <ul>
                <li>Andy Warhol</li>
                <p>Beginning out as a commercial artist, he brought the ethos of promotion into fine art, even going so far as to say, “Making money is art.” Such attitudes blew away the existential declarations of Abstract Expressionism. Although he’s recognized for captions such as Campbell’s Soup, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley, his greatest invention was himself.</p><br>
                <li>Leonardo da Vinci</li>
                <p>The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is known as a genius, not only for masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper and The Lady with an Ermine but also for his designs of technologies (aircraft, tanks, automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.</p><br>
                <li>Michelangelo</li>
                <p>The original Renaissance Man, Leonardo is known as a genius, not only for masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper and The Lady with an Ermine but also for his designs of technologies (aircraft, tanks, automobile) that were five hundred years in the future.</p><br>
                <li>Jackson Pollock</li>
                <p>Hindered by addiction, self-doubt, and awkwardness as a conventional painter, Pollock transformed his faults in a short but intense period between 1947 and 1950 when he performed the drip ideas that connected his fame. Avoiding the easel to lay his paintings flat on the floor, he used house paint right from the can, throwing and dropping thin skeins of pigment that left behind a solid record of his movements.</p><br>
                <li>Henri Matisse</li>
                <p>No artist is as intimately attached to the delights of colour as Henri Matisse. His work was all about twisted curves rooted in the ideas of symbolic art and was constantly concentrated on the beguiling satisfaction of colour and tone.</p><br>
                <li>Edvard Munch</li>
                <p>I scream you scream we all scream for Munch’s The Scream, the Mona Lisa of anxiety. In 2012, a pastel variant of Edvard Munch’s iconic invocation of modern anxiety got a then-astronomical price of $120 million at auction. Munch’s career was more than just a single painting.</p><br>
                <li>Maqbool Fida Husain</li>
                <p>M.F. Husain was born in Pandharpur Maharashtra. Primarily a self-taught artist, Husain was part of the revolutionary Progressive Artists’ Group. In 1947 his first exhibition was conducted at the Bombay Art Society where his painting Sunhera Sansaar was shown. From 1948 to 1950 there were a series of exhibitions of Husain's paintings all over India. By the 1960s, his paintings were exhibited in the art galleries of Prague and Zurich. Husain soon became a name synonymous with modern Indian art due to his fearless depiction of his imagination, as well as, his willingness to absorb international influences. However, most of his work since his formative years has been rooted in Indian vocabulary and aesthetics.</p>
                <li>Rene Magritte</li>
                <p>The name René Magritte is widely recognized by art lovers and agnostics alike, and for good reason: He utterly transformed our expectations of what is real and what is not. When someone describes something as “surreal,” the chances are good that an image by Magritte pops into his or her head.</p>
